In an empty room on the floor is a dormant fly with coordinates (X, Y, Z) . The spider, which was on one of the walls, on the floor, on the ceiling, or suspended from a web, began to move towards her along the shortest path.
Input data:
fly coordinates (X, Y, Z);
spider coordinates (X, Y, Z);

Create a point class with coordinate attributes and methods that calculate:
1. The distance between the fly and the spider in a straight line
2. The path that the spider needs to go to the fly. The spider can only descend vertically.
Answers must be rounded to 5 decimal places

It is also necessary to check the input data: the fly is on the floor, the input data may be incorrect
