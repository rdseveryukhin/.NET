There are several types of cinema visitors:

Ordinary visitor (viewer) - pays the full cost of the ticket, no discounts are provided.

Regular visitor - for every 10 visits receives an additional 1% discount, but no more than 20%

For example, if a regular visitor bought 28 tickets in the past and came to buy 2 more tickets. He will receive a 2% discount on the 29th ticket and a 3% discount on the 30th ticket. If the cost of the ticket is 100, then he will pay 98 + 97 = 195 for the purchase.

Student (student) - for every third visit a 50% discount is given

Pensioner (pensioner) - receives a 50% discount on each visit, for every fifth visit a 100% discount is given

The ticket price, taking into account the discount, is mathematically rounded to two decimal places.

Input example:

student 10 25 1

student - type of visitor

10 - the number of sessions the viewer has already attended

25 - ticket price

1 - how many tickets the visitor buys

You need to display the total cost of the purchase, taking into account discounts.
