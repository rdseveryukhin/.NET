1. Create the Matrix class, specify in it the DATA field for storing the matrix. The type of DATA field can be any of the two described above. We also advise you to indicate the fields for the size of the matrix: the number of lines and columns.

2. Create the Read () method to read the matrix from the console. The data is entered as follows:
-the lines and the number of columns through the gap
-knowledge of the first line through the gap
-the knowledge of the second line through the gap
...
-knowledge of the nth line through a gap

3. Create the Write () method to output the matrix into the console in the same format as indicated above, with the transfer of the line at the end
Be careful: the Write () method must return the matrix without any extra characters, otherwise the test will not be passed
UPD: Everywhere and then the matrix can store material numbers, consider this and use the type of Double

4. It is necessary to realize the multiplication of the matrix by the actual number, addition and subtraction of matrices, multiplication of matrices.

5. Transporation of the matrix is an operation over the matrix, when it turns around its axis, while the columns of the original matrix become lines of the resulting.
